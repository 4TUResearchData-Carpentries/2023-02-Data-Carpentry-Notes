## Introduction

This ***awesome*** well-written guide uses the **tidyverse** package along with the *SAFI*
dataset, which has columns that include:

- village
  - name of village
- interview_date
  - date of interview
    - ISO standard
- no_members
- years_liv
- respondent_wall_type
- rooms

This is a list of my favourite variables

1. interview_date
2. village
3. rooms
4. no_members
